liboil: LibOIL (A Library of Optimized Inner Loops)
liboil:
liboil: Liboil is a collection of functions that often benefit from having
liboil: special implementations on various architectures or CPUs.  Each
liboil: function in liboil has several implementations which may perform
liboil: faster or slower on a given CPU.  Some implementations use alternate
liboil: algorithms, some use hand-crafted assembly, and some use special
liboil: instructions that are only available on certain CPUs, such as MMX,
liboil: SSE, or Altivec. The fastest implementation is automatically chosen
liboil: at runtime.
